# Admin Guide

The admin panel provides simple management tools.

- **Orders** tab lists all purchases. Use the *Hold* toggle to place a payout on hold until a dispute is resolved.
- **Reports** tab shows flagged prompts. Review the content and take appropriate action.

Access the panel at `/admin` after logging in with an admin account.
